```
Usage:
    coderev.sh [-r revision] [-w width] [-o outdir] [-y] [-d name] \
               [-F comment-file | -m 'comment...'] [file...]

    coderev.sh [-r revision] [-w width] [-o outdir] [-y] [-d name] \
               [-F comment-file | -m 'comment...'] [-p num] < patch-file

    All options are optional.

    -r revision     - Specify a revision number, or symbol (PREV, BASE, HEAD)
                      in svn, see svn books for details.  Default revision is
                      revision of your working copy

    -w width        - Let code review pages wrap in specific column

    -o outdir       - The output dir to save code review pages

    -y              - Force overwrite if outdir alredy exists

    -d name         - Use this name instead of a dynamically timestamp string
                      as coderev directory basename

    -F comment-file - A file to read comments from

    -m 'comment...' - To set inline comments, note '-m' precedes '-F', if
                      neither `-F' nor `-m' is specified, $EDITOR (default
                      is vi) will be invoked to write comments

    file...         - File/dir list you want to diff, default is `.'

    patch-file      - A patch file (usually generated by `diff(1)' or `svn
                      diff') to use to generate coderev

    -p num          - When use a patch file, this option is passed to utility
                      `patch(1)' to strip the smallest prefix containing num
                      leading slashes from each file name found in the patch

Example 1:

    You are working on the most up-to-date revision and made some local
    modification, now you want to invite others to review, just run

        cd workspace
        coderev.sh -w80

    This generates coderev pages (wrap in column 80) in a temp directory.  Then
    copy the coderev dir to somewhere on a web host and send out the link for
    review.  Read coderevrc.sample for how to make this automated.

Example 2:

    You are making local modification when someone else committed some changes
    on foo.c and bar directory, you want to see what's different between your
    copy and the up-to-date revision in repository, just run

        cd workspace
        coderev.sh -r HEAD -o ~/public_html/coderev foo.c bar/

    This generate coderev based on diffs between HEAD revision (up-to-date
    version in repository) and locally modified revision, this will retrieve
    diffs from SVN server, output pages saved under your web home, i.e., if
    you correctly configured a web server on your work station you can visit
    http://server/~you/coderev to see the coderev.  (Replace HEAD with a
    revision number this example also works for CVS).

Example 3:

    Someone invite you to review his code change, unfortunately he sent you raw
    diff generated by `cvs diff' named `foo.patch', you can run

        cd workspace
        cvs up
        coderev.sh -m 'applying patch foo' -o ~/public_html/foo < foo.patch

    Again, you can visit http://server/~you/foo to see his change.  Note you
    may need to use option `-p num' depends on how he generated the patch.

Example 4:

    You want to see what's different between previous revision and your
    current working copy (modified or not) for foo.c and dir bar/, just run

        cd workspace
        svn diff -r PREV foo.c bar/ | coderev.sh -w80 -F comments

    This read comments from file `comments' and generate coderev in a temp
    directory.  (Replace PREV with a revision number this example also works
    for CVS).
